-- DESCRIPTION:
-- 
-- This package is about the type, basic properties and subprograms related
-- to so called "electrical" devices as they are modelled in the schematic
-- and in the board.
-- These devices have a representation in schematic and mostly in the board.

		-- CS use a cursor to the model instead ?

		-- The deployed units like PWR, A, B, ...
		-- Virtual devices have only one unit (like the GND symbol).
		-- Real devices like a single resistor have one unit.
		-- Real devices like FPGAs have many units (like PWR1, PWR2, GPIO1, GPIO2, ...):

				partcode	: pac_device_partcode.bounded_string; -- R_PAC_S_0805_VAL_100R
				-- For virtual packages (test points, edge connectors, ...)
				-- usually no partcode is required.

				-- The purpose indicates what the device is doing.
				-- It is usually required for devices that require interaction
				-- with the user of a PCBA:
				purpose		: pac_device_purpose.bounded_string; -- brightness_control

				-- The package variant:
				variant		: pac_package_variant_name.bounded_string; -- D, N

				-- This is layout related. In the layout, the package has a position
				-- and placeholders for name, value and purpose.
				-- The assembly side of a package is by default TOP.
				-- As a result of a flip operation, position.face changes from top to bottom
				-- or vice versa.
				-- Flipping a device to top or bottom means it will be drawn
				-- mirrored along its Y-axis.
				position	: et_board_coordinates.type_package_position; -- incl. rotation and face

				text_placeholders	: et_device_placeholders.packages.type_text_placeholders;
				-- CS: rename to placeholders

				status : type_object_status;
				
			when APPEARANCE_VIRTUAL => null;

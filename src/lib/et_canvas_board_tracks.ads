-- IMPORTANT:
-- This is about drawing conductor segments which are connected
-- with a net.
-- Freetracks in conductor layers are handled in et_canvas_board_lines.

	use pac_geometry_2;

	use et_canvas_board.pac_canvas;
	use pac_path_and_bend;

	

	
	
	
	type type_snap_mode is (

		NEAREST_OBJECT, -- track starts/ends at the nearest object
		NO_SNAP);

	-- Displays the track properties:
	procedure show_track_properties;


	-- Advances to the next snap mode:
	procedure next_snap_mode;
	
	
	-- to be output in the status bar:
	status_draw_track : constant string := 
		status_click_left 
		& "or "
		& status_press_space
		& "to draw track." 
		& status_hint_for_abort;



	-- This procedure is required in order to clarify
	-- which object among the proposed objects is meant.
	-- On every call of this procedure we advance from one
	-- proposed airwire to the next in a circular manner
	-- and set it as "selected":
	procedure clarify_airwire;


	-- Builds a live path. This procedure requires to be called twice:
	-- first time for the start and the second time for the end point of the path.
	-- The current bend style of global variable live_path is taken into account.
	-- The path may be started and finished with different tools. For example start
	-- with MOUSE and finish with KEYBOARD or vice versa.
	procedure make_path (
		tool	: in type_tool;
		point	: in type_vector_model);

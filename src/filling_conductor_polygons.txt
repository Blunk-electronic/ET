FILLING OF CONDUCTOR POLYGONS (FILL AREAS)
==========================================

package et_board_ops
--------------------

FILLING SOLID AREAS:

procedure route_solid

start_point_in is the lower left corner of the polygon.

procedure compute_fill_lines takes start_point_in.
 
	- A copy of start_point_in, now just called "start_point", 
	- moves up from row to row until the topmost row of the fill area.

	- procedure fill_row computes fill lines required for a single row.
		- 1. rows are filled from left to right with horizontal fill lines
		- 2. query distance from start_point to next obstacle by calling
		     get_distance_to_obstacle (mark A)
		- 3. If start_point is valid to start a fill line (mark C):
			1. start_point becomes the start of the fill line
			2. move start_point right to the place where the obstacle
			   has been found.
			3. start_point becomes the end of the current fill line
			4. collect the current fill line
			5. Find the nearest point after the next obstacle (to the right) 
			   after start_point by calling get_distance_after_obstacle.
			6. If the point is valid to start another fill line (mark D),
			   move start_point
			   to that place and compute next fill line (jump back to mark A).
			   If the point is NOT valid (means there is no place to
			   start another fill line), abort filling the current row
			   and proceed with next row above.
		- 4. If start_point is NOT valid to start a fill line (mark B), then
			 call get_distance_after_obstacle to find the next place, after
			 the obstacle, where it is allowed to start a fill line. 
			 Move start_point to that place. If no place found, abort
			 filling the current row and proceed wit next row above.
